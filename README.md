# Ex3_Graph_Algorithms <br>
## Sivan Cohen & Hodaya Turgeman <br>

in this assigment we were required to implement and to design data structures and algorithms on graphs.  <br>
In addition,  we were required to creat a graphical interface that allows you to load, save, draw graphs and run the algorithms on them. <br>
We were required to implement the following interfaces:   
1. GeoLocation - this interface represents a geo location <x,y,z>. <br>
   so we make those 3 field: coordinate of x, y and z. <br>
3. NodeData - this interface represents the set of operations applicable on a node (vertex) in a (directional) weighted graph. <br>
   for each node we save this information: its unique id, its GeoLocation, weight, info and tag. (the last 3 fields are not necessary). <br>
5. EdgeData - this interface represents the set of operations applicable on a directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph. <br>
   for every edge we save: its source and destination node, its weight, info and tag. (the last 2 fields are not necessary). <br>
7. DirectedWeightedGraph - this interface represents a Directional Weighted Graph. <br>
   each graph has set of nodes and set of edges and count which is the amount of nodes and edges in the graph. <br>
   we represent the nodes by an hashmap which its key is the node's id and its value is the object Node which belong to this id. <br>
   for the edges we use 3 hashmap for getting better running time in some operatins: <br>
   first hashmap: its key is point which its x coordinateis is the node src key, and its y coordinateis the node dest key. <br>
   the hashmap value is the the object Edge which belong to this nodes key. <br>
   second hashmap: its key is the node src, its value is a hash map which its key is the dest node and the value is the object Edge which belong to this nodes key. <br>
   third hashmap: its key is the node dest, its value is a hash map which its key is the src node and the value is the object Edge which belong to this nodes key. <br>
9. DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms - This interface represents a Directed (positive) Weighted Graph Theory Algorithms including: <br>
   1. #### clone(copy) <br>
   2. #### init(graph) <br>
   4. #### isConnected - strongly (all ordered pairs connected) <br>
       we implement this method by using Kosarajuâ€™s BFS algorithm. <br>
   6. #### shortestPathDist(int src, int dest) <br>
       we implement this method by using Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes so the sum of edge weight is minimal. <br>
   8. #### List<NodeData> shortestPath(int src, int dest) <br>
       we used the algorithm above and save the nodes in the path in the returned list. <br>
   9. #### NodeData center <br> 
       this method finds the Node which minimizes the max distance to all the other nodes
   10. #### List<NodeData> tsp(List<NodeData> cities); <br>
        we used a greedy algorithem which compute the shortest path by Dijkstra algorithm. <br>
   11. #### save(file) <br>
   12. #### load(file) <br>
  
 when we implement the interfaces we make sure to do Junit and check our funtions. <br>
 We tested them on graphs which we created manually by ourselves and after implementing the load, we tested the functions on the graphs which were provided to us. <br>

 ## How to use our program
- Download The project from here.  <br>
- open the folder of the project and run the cmd from its address.  <br>
- write this Line in the terminal command: java -jar Ex2.jar json_file_name.json  <br>

The program window will be open, click the zoom out and the window will be displayed in full screen with the graph from the file. <br>
Note that in the file button there is an option to load a file, save a file of the graph which you were created and exit the program. <br>
for the another oporations: <br>
Click the fit button you want and follow this instructions. for: <br>
- Add Node \ Delete Node \ Get Node Information: click the desired node by the mouse. <br>
- Add edge \ Delete edge \ Get edge Info \ Find the shortest distance between two nodes: click the two desired nodes. The first click defines the source node, and the second the destination node. <br>
- To check if the graph IsConnected or to get the center of the graph: click the appropriate button. <br>
- For the tsp, click startTsp and begin to select the nodes which you want to find a route between them. at the end of the selection click endTsp. <br>
Note that the nodes that return from tsp and shortestPathList will be colored for a few seconds in different color. <br>
